Welcome to the Clean Code Project! This project aims to gather ideas, discussions, and examples related to clean code practices and what it means to have clean, good, or bad code.

## What is Clean Code?

Clean code refers to writing code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain. It focuses on readability, simplicity, and expressiveness. Clean code is not only functional but also has a clear structure, good naming conventions, proper documentation, and follows best practices.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch for your contribution.
4. Add your contributions, which can include code examples, articles, or discussions, to the project.
5. Commit your changes and push them to your forked repository.
6. Open a pull request (PR) from your branch to the main repository.
7. Provide a descriptive title and explain the purpose of your contribution in the PR description.
8. Wait for the project maintainers to review your contribution. They may provide feedback or request changes.
9. Once approved, your contribution will be merged into the main branch and become a part of the Clean Code Project.
